<p>Over the past 35 years, NFEC has worked relentlessly towards our mission
of making Singapore a fire safe nation. From organising key events such
as the upcoming Fire Safety Asia Conference (FiSAC), to going for post-fire
sharing sessions with household residents, NFEC works with different stakeholders
every day to serve the nation.</p>
<p>During his welcome address, Mr John Wu, Vice-Chairman NFEC, emphasised
the importance for the community to work together in driving NFECâ€™s mission
towards the next decade and beyond. In this heightened security climate,
the community plays a crucial role in keeping Singapore safe and secure.
Equipping the community with life-saving skills and knowledge of how to
respond to emergencies will put them in good stead to deal with security
threats such as in the event of a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>On top of the Anniversary Celebration, NFEC also gave out the Fire Safety
Awards (FSA) during the ceremony. The presentation of FSA serves to appreciate
all stakeholders for their commitment and contributions towards maintaining
a high standard of fire safety in their premises and building a safer environment
for all.
