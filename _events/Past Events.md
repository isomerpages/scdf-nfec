Over the past 35 years, NFEC has worked relentlessly towards our mission of making Singapore a fire safe nation. From organising key events such as the upcoming Fire Safety Asia Conference (FiSAC), to going for post-fire sharing sessions with household residents, NFEC works with different stakeholders every day to serve the nation.

During his welcome address, Mr John Wu, Vice-Chairman NFEC, emphasised the importance for the community to work together in driving NFECâ€™s mission towards the next decade and beyond. In this heightened security climate, the community plays a crucial role in keeping Singapore safe and secure. Equipping the community with life-saving skills and knowledge of how to respond to emergencies will put them in good stead to deal with security threats such as in the event of a terrorist attack.

On top of the Anniversary Celebration, NFEC also gave out the Fire Safety Awards (FSA) during the ceremony. The presentation of FSA serves to appreciate all stakeholders for their commitment and contributions towards maintaining a high standard of fire safety in their premises and building a safer environment for all.
