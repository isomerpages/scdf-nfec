<h3>NFEC Fire Safety Seminar 2025 – Titled: ‘Learn; Apply; Share’</h3>
<p>The annual NFEC Fire Safety Seminar was held at the Singapore Expo on
26 Aug. Deputy Commissioner Ling Young Ern, Deputy Commissioner (Operations
&amp; Resilience), SCDF, was the Guest of Honour.</p>
<p>Organised by the NFEC and supported by the Singapore Civil Defence Force,
the seminar saw the attendance of about 1,500 participants which included
industry experts, fire safety managers and practitioners, and workplace
safety and health officers. This marks the highest number of participants
since the seminar’s inception in 2005.</p>
<p>Themed “Learn: Apply: Share”, the seminar served as a vital platform for
participants to gain valuable insights into fire safety best practices,
emergency response and crisis management strategies. Six speakers from
various professional agencies and institutions were invited to share their
expertise on the latest fire safety developments and trends.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The event culminated in an engaging panel discussion focused on exchanging
best practices on fire safety and emergency preparedness at the workplace.</p>
<p>The NFEC would like to thank all participants for their strong support!
We look forward to strengthening our partnership as we work towards building
a fire-safe and emergency-prepared Singapore.</p>
