The National Fire And Emergency Preparedness Council (NFEC) is committed towards promoting fire prevention and civil emergency preparedness to make Singapore safe and secure.<br>

The logo has been redesigned with a refreshing outlook to invoke a renewed vigour, drive and purpose.<br>

It comprises two key elements: a flame and the acronym of NFEC. The red and orange heart-shape flame with an accompanying livery line connotes first aid, fire safety and emergency preparedness (the key focus of NFEC) as well as the symbiotic relationship between NFEC and SCDF. &nbsp;Above all, it signifies NFEC’s strong partnership with its stakeholders and the community-at-large.<br>

The unique, vertical arrangement of the acronym ‘NFEC’ is not only an attention grabber but also highlights a council that is constantly evolving based on the latest developments and changing times.<br>
