<h3>Logo</h3>

<p>The logo has been redesigned with a refreshing outlook to invoke a renewed
vigour, drive and purpose.
<br>
</p>
<p>It comprises two key elements: a flame and the acronym of NFEC. The red
and orange heart-shape flame with an accompanying livery line connotes
first aid, fire safety and emergency preparedness (the key focus of NFEC)
as well as the symbiotic relationship between NFEC and SCDF. &nbsp;Above
all, it signifies NFEC’s strong partnership with its stakeholders and the
community-at-large.
<br>
</p>
<p>The unique, vertical arrangement of the acronym ‘NFEC’ is not only an
attention grabber but also highlights a council that is constantly evolving
based on the latest developments and changing times.
