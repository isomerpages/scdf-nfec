### Guidelines On The Use of Common Areas in HDB Estates

There are hundreds of fires in HDB common areas every year. Obstruction to common corridors and fire fighting equipment (e.g. dry risers &amp; hose reels) can seriously hamper fire fighting efforts and smooth evacuation in a fire emergency, endangering your lives. Following the guidelines will help create a safer living environment for your loved ones.<br>
<br>

### Guidelines On Usage of Common Corridors

While SCDF does not permit the storage of combustible materials along common corridors, we can allow for the placement of shoe racks, provided;-

a.&nbsp;It is for the sole purpose of keeping shoes, whereby, it would not constitute a substantial fire load,  
b.&nbsp;A minimum clear escape passage of 1.2 m clearance is to be maintained from the parapet wall where the shoe rack is to be allowed.  
c.&nbsp;No objects are to be placed along common corridors less than 1.2 m wide.&nbsp;  
d.&nbsp;No placement of items such as clothing racks unless they can be easily folded or removed in times of emergency so that they do not obstruct the escape route.
