1. Sparklers should be kept in a closed box and away from flames.
2. When being used, it should be lit at arm's length and only one at a time.
3. Lighted sparklers should never be thrown at combustible materials.
4. When a sparkler goes out, do not immediately touch the hot end as it could still be burning. Ideally, put the hot end in a bucket of water to fully cool it down.
5. Finally, follow the safety instructions as stated by the manufacturer.

#### Treating Burns &amp; Scalds

Burns and scalds are injuries to body tissue caused by heat, chemicals, or radiation.

* Reduce the spread of heat, pain, and swelling by placing the burnt area under cold running water or immersing it in cold water for at least 10 minutes.
* Gently remove any rings, watches, belts, or constricting clothing from the injured area before it starts to swell.
* Cover the injured area with clean, preferably sterile, non-fluffy material.
* A burnt face may be covered with a gauze mask, with holes, cut into it to assist the victim in breathing.
* Do not break blisters or remove anything that is sticking to a burn.
* Do not apply lotions, ointments, or fat to the injured area.

#### If your clothing catches fire

1. Stop. Do not panic and run.
2. Whether indoors or outdoors, drop down immediately, covering your face with your hands.
3. Roll over and over to put out the flames.  Rolling smothers the flames by removing the oxygen. Covering your face with your hands prevents the flames from burning your face and help keep fumes and smoke from reaching your lungs.
