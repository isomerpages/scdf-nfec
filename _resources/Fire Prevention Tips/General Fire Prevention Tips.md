2. When being used, it should be lit at arm's length and only one at a time.
3. Lighted sparklers should never be thrown at combustible materials.
4. When a sparkler goes out, do not immediately touch the hot end as it could still be burning. Ideally, put the hot end in a bucket of water to fully cool it down.
5. Finally, follow the safety instructions as stated by the manufacturer.
